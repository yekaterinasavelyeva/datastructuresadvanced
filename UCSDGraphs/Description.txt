Class: MapGraph

Modifications made to MapGraph (what and why): Implemented all required methods,
added validation method isNull(..) to check properties passed to addEdge(),
added constructPath(..) method to restore path from map produced by bfs method.
Implemented BFS method.

Class name: MapNode
Purpose and description of class: To describe node. Holds geographical location of the node and list of
outgoing edges. Hold method getNeighbours to get list of geographical points connected with edges to this node.

Class name: geography/GeographicPoint, geography/RoadSegment
Purpose and description of class: geography/GeographicPoint, geography/RoadSegment
Project built-in classes, reused for this particular solution, not in the roadgraph package. Used to describe geographical point and edge between points.
...

Overall Design Justification (4-6 sentences):
Design is quite simple: MapGraph object contains mapping from geographic point to MapNode.
MapNode holds its own geographic coordinate and list of outcoming edges. This solution re-uses objects already created in the project:
GeographicPoint (describes coordinate of MapNode) and RoadSegment (describes edge between two coordinates).
Bfs uses queue, within this method MapNode object gets converted to geographic node for further calculations.
Bfs method is divided in two parts: one calculates map of the path during breadth-first-search,
second - constructs List of geographic points to the goa from already created path map.
